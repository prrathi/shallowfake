This is a work-in-progress compilation of research efforts for **ShallowFake: Adversarial Attacks on Speech Recognition and Audio Deepfakes**. As of now, the code contains the following
* Environment setup, training scripts, example output for PGD (projected gradient descent) attack on Whisper speech recognition
  * environment includes `robust_speech` and `speechbrain` submodules that are individually updated but path and package dependencies aren't
* Sample script (`sample.py`) for NN preprocessing, training, and postprocessing
* Initial project report in `report.pdf`
